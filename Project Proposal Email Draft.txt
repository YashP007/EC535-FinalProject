Project Proposal (Draft Email)

Scope: 
Beagle Bone Black
Temperature Sensor (thermistor)
Traffic Light LEDs (Real-time display of temperature levels)
Other LEDs (for mock 'stove control')

Features:
- Implement server-based bi-directional control of the stove (mock stove control LEDs) and timer & interrupt-based temperature readings. 
- Implement a simple voltage-divider analog front end for thermistor reading w. a simple comparator circuit for input. (see circuit diagram below). 
- Implement a server + webapp through GitHub's app development system & servers. The embedded hardware will be writing to this webapp. (Not sure if webapp will be locally hosted yet). 
- Will reduce rootfs.img and boot.img files & implement sleep modes to minimize the power consumption of this proof-of concept system. Ideally, this system would be running on a low-power, lightweight embedded processor. 


We already have all the hardware for temperature sensing and comparator (i.e. nothing needs to be purchased). Will build this circuit on a breadboard, will take <1 hr.
