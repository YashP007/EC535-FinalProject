Project Proposal (Draft Email)

Hello Professor, 

We would like to implement a temperature monitoring device with various features. More information cited below: 


Scope: 
Beagle Bone Black
Temperature Sensor (thermistor)
Traffic Light LEDs (Real-time display of temperature levels)
Other LEDs (for mock 'stove control')

Features:
- Implement server-based bi-directional control of the stove (mock stove control LEDs) and timer & interrupt-based temperature readings. 
- Implement a simple voltage-divider analog front end for thermistor reading w. a simple comparator circuit for input. (see circuit diagram below). 
- Implement a server + webapp through GitHub's app development system & servers. The embedded hardware will be writing to this webapp. (Not sure if webapp will be locally hosted yet). 
- Will reduce rootfs.img and boot.img files & implement sleep modes to minimize the power consumption of this proof-of concept system. Ideally, this system would be running on a low-power, lightweight embedded processor. 


We already have all the hardware for temperature sensing and comparator (i.e. nothing needs to be purchased). 

Sincerely, 
Yash Patel and Leah Jones

Subject: EC535 Project Proposal

Hello Professor Coskun,

We’d like to propose a project centered on designing a small embedded system for temperature monitoring and control, using a smart-stove scenario as the application context. Our aim is to highlight core embedded system concepts: hardware/software co-design, interrupt handling, simple analog front ends, scheduling, power management, and lightweight communication between the device and a remote interface.

Hardware
• BeagleBone Black
• Thermistor with voltage divider
• Comparator circuit to generate an interrupt when temperature crosses a set threshold
• Traffic-light LEDs to show real-time temperature ranges
• Additional LEDs to serve as the mock stove controls

Planned Features
• Use timer-based sampling and comparator-triggered interrupts to acquire temperature data.
• Implement a small server plus simple web interface that supports bidirectional control of the mock stove LEDs and displays system status.
• Explore power-aware behavior by trimming the root filesystem and testing basic sleep modes on the BeagleBone.
• Demonstrate end-to-end behavior: sensing, interrupt response, local actuation, and remote control.

All sensing and comparator hardware is already available, and we can assemble the prototype on a breadboard quickly.

Please let us know if this scope aligns with project expectations or if you recommend any adjustments.

Best,
Yash Patel and Leah Jones
