Tasks:
0. Draw a State-machine diagram for logic flow & determine modules that need to be written
1. Write a kernel module to control indicator LEDs (Yash)
2. Write a kernel module to read from and be interrupted by the temperature-sensing hardware. (need to learn how to read from ADC) (Yash)
3. Write user-level code to read from and activate both .ko to implement overall behavior
4. Research and start to implement a basic wireless-server system
5. Connect the wireless server system to the temperature sensing and LED actuation back-end.
